# xmonad-setup
my setup files for xmonad

Lots of stuff from lots of places.  I'm just hacking at haskell here. I need to take some time to learn it better.
Still this seems to be working pretty well.  I'm still tweaking it, but it's pretty nice at this point. The keys
and commands are still in a lot of flux. But I'm slowly exploring everything I have and figuring out what I like and
don't like. The dzen key hints really helps with exploring and remembering what is there. And also finding things
that don't work quite the way they should or the way I want.

This is all pretty fresh. I've only been using xmonad 12 since July, 2016. This is my first major refactoring since
creating my initial xmonad.hs mess.

**Some key features**  
 * EZConfig
 * topic space 
 * grid select 
 * prompt & select search 
 * other prompts - man prompt, shell prompt,
 * floatkeys
 * magnifier 
 * named scratchpads 
 * submap keymaps with key hints popup via dzen2, thank you [pclewis!](https://github.com/pclewis/dotfiles/tree/master/xmonad/.xmonad) , 
 * working screenshot
 * dmenu 
 * xfce-panel.
 * emacs script to start emacs as client, or standalone, and to call an elisp function on startup. -- I use standalone emacs running mu4e for email and a separate emacs session for coding. Sometimes I want coding sessions to be homogoneous through emacs client and sometimes I want them standalone. This script takes care of that for me in a nice way.

I am not currently using this with the xfce-session manager.  I did for a while, but it seems unnecessary. I'm only using
the xfce-panel.  So somethings on the applications menu don't work. But I almost never use that menu.
